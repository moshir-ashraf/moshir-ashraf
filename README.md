    <strong>Mele: Real-time IoT Monitoring for Beehives and Apiaries</strong>: <em>Beekeeping has long been one of the quintessential agricultural activities that both provides humans
with sustenance, while also contributing to the betterment of the overall ecosystem and surrounding environment.
Unfortunately, until recently, beekeeping technology has remained relatively stagnant; mainly
relying on tried-and-true methods that have been passed down across generations of beekeepers. However,
the Mele-RIMBA hive aims to change that through utilizing cutting-edge IoT technology bolstered
by state-of-the-art AI models to aid in facilitating and improving the beekeeping profession through a
myriad of features, including continuous surveillance of beehive status and honey yield tracking along
with supremely efficient temperature and humidity regulation systems accompanied by a highly selective
intrusion prevention system. The Mele-RIMBA team aspires to provide bees with a safe, sustainable and
comfortable habitat ultimately improving bee health and honey production whilst supplying hive-owners
with a substantial upgrade option for their traditional outdated beehives.</em>

    <strong>Flavoured </strong> <em> is an E-commerce web application created as the SWE23004 Web Development course project to showcase the ability of 5 students in full stack developing. The front-end of the application showcases the use of HTML and CSS and EC6 "*JavaScript*", while the back-end utilizes the MERN stack in its development.  
Flavoured is an online store that specializes in selling custom and specific food **flavourings** in various **shades**. The idea is to bring all customers the delight of enjoying their favourite snacks ; through emulating their taste and color, in two easy to use products *(powder - liquid)*. Many estimated flavours are available on the store from the get-go contrived of a collection of our team's favourite snacks and multiple surveys that were ran through our university, *MIU,* mates. Our slogan "***Taste the Shades***" was designed to imply that both the visuals and taste of our products mean a lot to us.</em>

    <strong>Basma Hotel</strong> <em> E-Booking Software is a comprehensive software solution for managing the
pre-existing 4-star rated Aswanian hotel and its operations effectively. The system aims to upgrade
the conventional hotel management processes through enhancing customer experience
and optimizing resource utilization. Key features include a booking engine that handles room
reservations and their corresponding gateway billing with alliance to the hotels availability
calendar, alongside managing guests’ stays at the hotel. The software tries to also provide entertainment
resources and informative data about the hotel’s facilities and its safety regulations.
The SRS document serves as a blueprint for software development, ensuring that all participants
have a clear understanding of the system’s functionalities and performance expectations..</em>

    <strong>OutBurst</strong> <em> is a distributed game server designed to support a multiplayer gaming experience. It uses gRPC for efficient communication between the master server and game servers, ensuring seamless coordination and load distribution. The client-side is implemented using Flask, providing an intuitive and accessible web-based interface for players.
The game itself revolves around themed word packs (datasets), with each round assigning one player as the clue giver. The clue giver views a word from the selected theme and provides hints to guide the other players in guessing the word correctly. This structure promotes collaboration, creativity, and an engaging social gaming experience.

    <strong>Facial-Emotions-Recognition</strong>: <em>This project showcases a fully custom-built real-time image classifier for facial emotion recognition, developed entirely from scratch without relying on pre-trained models. The architecture was designed and implemented manually, utilizing convolutional layers and other advanced neural network components to extract and analyze facial features. The classifier processes input in real-time, accurately identifying and categorizing human emotions, demonstrating a deep understanding of neural network design and implementation.</em>

    <strong>FMDs: Forecasting Global Trends in Mental Health
Disorders</strong>: <em>In a world grappling with deteriorating mental
health, this paper aims to forecast the prevalence and
frequency of mental disorders across three distinct datasets
obtained from Kaggle. The disorders examined include
schizophrenia, anxiety disorders, bipolar
disorder, eating disorders, drug addiction,
alcoholism, and depression. Statistical models
such as ARIMA, HWES, AR, and MA, as well as deep-learning
models like LSTM and RNN, were comprehensively assessed
and compared based on their performance across four key
metrics: MSE, MAE, RMSE, and SMAPE. The results underscore
the relevance of trend-based patterns in mental disorders
globally. However, the study strongly favors Exponential
Smoothing for its superior predictive capabilities and robust
trend capture. This research contributes to advancing mental
health forecasting methodologies, providing valuable insights
into effective predictive modeling approaches for global trends
in mental health disorders.</em>

    <strong>ASD Predictions</strong>: </em>Autism Spectrum Disorder is a multidimensional
neurological developmental disorder that includes a wide
plethora of mental disorders targeting one’s social and behavioral
abilities. Gaining a perceptive understanding of a topic like ASD
is essential in one’s lifespan, whether the symptoms displayed
are mild or severely debilitating. Due to the populous size of
clinical terms under the disorder’s spectrum and the drastic gap
between each symptom’s severity, the diagnosis of ASD became
a long and tribulating task for experts and professionals alike.
The purpose of this paper is to present and compare different
Machine Learning Classifiers [ Categorical Boosting, K-Nearest
Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Decision
Tree, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes ] and use their Training
Algorithms [ Train-Test Splitting, K-Folds Cross-Validation ] to
develop a quick and accurate Labeler [ ASD: “YES” ? “NO”
] for afflicted individuals based on multiple Datasets [ Generic,
Adolescent, Children, Young, Adult ], [ ASD ] aiming for an early
diagnosis and an overall better understanding of the disorder.
For each dataset, four Performance Metrics are extracted after
applying the 7 ML models and the two training algorithms [
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score ]. The resulting metrics
are then displayed and compared to conclude the most accurate
trained model for each dataset and with each of the training
algorithms.</em>

    <strong>MCMC</strong>: <em>A researched and implemented highly efficient
program based on a Randomized Monte Carlo Markov Chain
algorithm using C++ to predict the probable location of a police
roadblock after a set amount of hours given it’s initial set-
up location. Randomized approach is an approach that solves
problems by using methods that rely on a certain degree of
randomness to find solutions with lower time complexity than
other traditional approaches. Monte Carlo algorithms are a type
of randomized algorithms that try to reach a sufficient solution
within a specified number of attempts. Police roadblocks usually
cause massive traffic jams that most people would rather avoid
but have no possible guaranteed method to evade them despite
their best efforts. Markov Chains are stochastic models which are
used to predict the next possible transition based on the current
state of affairs. A typical MCMC algorithm uses the Metropolis
method to generate the probability that a select state would be
the current state after a number of iterations.</em>
